            Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, 
            he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at peace in the moment, 
            hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. 
            He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. 
            He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.

            Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part 
            of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was 
            like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange 
            and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her 
            husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which 
            they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes 
            made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.
